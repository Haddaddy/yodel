Yodel
=====

Yodel is an unofficial Yik Yak client for Windows Phone 8.1, written in JavaScript with WinJS.

As it is an unofficial client (i.e. not associated with Yik Yak, Inc.), features may break at any 
time due to breaking API changes. Yeah, it sucks. Remember kids, if you make a cool web service, 
it will make developers happy if you provide a public API.

The API library used is a JavaScript port of Joseph Connor's [pyak Python API library](https://github.com/joseph346/pyak).
